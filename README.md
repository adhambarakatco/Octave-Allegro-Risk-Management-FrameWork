# Business Continuity and Risk Management (BCRM) - OCTAVE Allegro Framework

## Overview

This project applies the OCTAVE Allegro Risk Assessment Framework to assess and manage risks within the **Electronic Health Record (EHR) system** at a University Hospital. The project consists of multiple milestones, each focusing on critical aspects of the risk management process, including asset identification, business impact analysis, attack profiling, and potential damage assessment.

The OCTAVE Allegro framework is used to evaluate and mitigate risks associated with sensitive healthcare data, ensuring that the hospital can maintain its operations and comply with legal and regulatory requirements.

## Project Description

The project aims to provide a comprehensive risk assessment of the **University Hospital's EHR System** using the **OCTAVE Allegro Framework**. It involves:

1. Identifying and defining the information assets critical to the hospital's operations.
2. Analyzing the potential risks these assets face from various attack vectors.
3. Evaluating the consequences of successful attacks.
4. Recommending countermeasures to reduce the identified risks.

The project is divided into three key milestones, each contributing to a well-rounded understanding of how to ensure business continuity in the face of cyber threats.

## Technologies Used

- **OCTAVE Allegro Framework**: A risk assessment framework for identifying, managing, and mitigating risks within organizational systems.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Used for documenting the analysis and generating risk reports.
- **Microsoft Excel/Sheets**: For creating weighted impact analysis tables and risk assessment charts.

## Milestones

### Milestone 1: Risk Assessment

The first milestone involves applying the **OCTAVE Allegro** framework to assess risks within the EHR system. This step includes:

- **Defining critical information assets** like the EHR database, patient portal, and network infrastructure.
- **Identifying potential threats** to these assets, such as phishing, ransomware, and insider threats.
- **Ranking risks** based on their operational, reputational, and compliance impacts.

The analysis helps to identify vulnerabilities in the hospital's infrastructure and defines mitigation strategies to ensure the security of sensitive health data.

### Milestone 2: Business Impact Analysis

In Milestone 2, the **Business Impact Analysis (BIA)** is performed using a weighted analysis table. The task includes:

- **Identifying critical business assets** like the EHR system, clinical workstations, and backup systems.
- **Setting recovery priorities** for these assets based on their impact on patient care and hospital operations.
- **Defining Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs)** and **Recovery Point Objectives (RPOs)** to ensure quick restoration in case of system failures.

The goal of this milestone is to understand the potential consequences of disruptions and create a recovery strategy for maintaining hospital operations.

### Milestone 3: Attack Profile and Damage Assessment

Milestone 3 focuses on identifying potential attack vectors that could compromise the EHR system. The steps include:

- **Identifying attack vectors** such as phishing, credential stuffing, remote access abuse, and insider threats.
- **Analyzing the motivations and capabilities of potential attackers** (cybercriminals, insiders, etc.).
- **Assessing potential damage** from successful attacks, considering factors like safety, confidentiality, and financial impact.

This milestone helps to simulate realistic threat scenarios and evaluate the potential consequences of these attacks, providing insights into how to improve the system's security posture.

## How to Run
